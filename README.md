# gnomepaper
A simple Python script for modifying GNOME's default wallpaper list

## Functions:
List wallpapers,
Backup wallpapers,
Add a wallpaper (needs sudo privileges),
Remove a wallpaper (needs sudo privileges)

## Install
For you can only run the script with the `python` command.
```
python gnomepaper.py
```
If you want to use it in the terminal without having to enter the script's path every time, you can add an `alias` to your `~/.bashrc`.
> ~/.bashrc
```
...
alias gnomepaper='python /path/to/file/gnomepaper.py
...
```
If you want me to add a installer that adds the script to the PATH, feel free to ask!
